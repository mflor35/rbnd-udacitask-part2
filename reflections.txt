# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    I spent around 12 hours working on this project. I found myself forgetting were
    I left off since I stopped working on the project for a few days.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    The most rewarding challenge is being able to run the program with no errors.
    I also found satisfying being able to use a icalendar gem to export the events
    to an .ics file. I did not know where to start at first but after spending time
    reading the documentation I figured something out.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    Feature 1: The ability to export the events in the todo list to an .ics.
        I thought it would be an essential feature to integrate with calendar
        software. I wanted to export the todo list to Google Calendar but the
        ideas, as of right now, is beyond my understanding.

    Feature 2: I borrowed the idea of changing the priority level of an item.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    I feel I was able to refactor the code very well. I tried to implement most the
    the suggestion they had given me in previous projects, but I still feel a bit
    uncomfortable writing one liners. I also think I can do better at being DRY.

    Oh! I also need to work on making sure that my git commits have no spelling errors.
